## Starting skills

In order to qualify for the development of their theses, students in the cancer molecular dynamics laboratory must work on the following skills:

* Cellular and molecular biology of cancer.
* Computer programming with python language.
* Design of pharmacological therapies.
* Communication skills in a scientific context and dissemination.

* [Bionformatics course in github](https://github.com/Nanocell-Lab/bioinf_4115025).
* [Python course from 1024](https://www.1024programadores.cl/recursos).

Then they specialize in skills in these areas:
* Multiomics analysis and heterogeneity in cancer: genomics, proteomics and multiomics.
* Design of drugs for receptor kinases associated with neoplastic proliferation.
* Design of oncological subcellular therapy based on transporter proteins.
* Software development to accelerate drug design.

## Advanced Skills
