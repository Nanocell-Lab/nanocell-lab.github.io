  bio: >
    B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas have a high frequency of driver structural
    variants, especially those that involve placing the oncogenes MYC, BCL2,
    BCL6, and CCND1 under the control of potent immunoglobulin enhancers.
    My project utilizes whole genome and targeted sequencing to characterize
    these driver SVs across B-NHLs with a goal of understanding the mechanisms
    by which they arise. I'm also interested in using gene expression and
    mutation data to facilitate the classification of rare and/or poorly
    characterized lymphomas, to identify progonostic and predictive biomarkers
    and targetable vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the development
    of novel therapies.
