    B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas have a high frequency of driver structural
    variants, especially those that involve placing the oncogenes MYC, BCL2,
    BCL6, and CCND1 under the control of potent immunoglobulin enhancers.
    My project utilizes whole genome and targeted sequencing to characterize
    these driver SVs across B-NHLs with a goal of understanding the mechanisms
    by which they arise. I'm also interested in using gene expression and
    mutation data to facilitate the classification of rare and/or poorly
    characterized lymphomas, to identify progonostic and predictive biomarkers
    and targetable vulnerabilities that can be exploited in the development
    of novel therapies.

    My research aims to understand the role of recurrent cis-regulatory
    mutations in mantle cell lymphoma (MCL).
    Specifically, I am characterizing a potential role for alternative
    splicing in the progression of MCL.
    This work uses a variety of molecular biology tools and bioinformatic
    approaches to determine how mutations in RNA binding proteins
    affect in vitro cell behaviour.
    I am a passionate advocate for equity, diversity, and inclusion and
    enjoy communicating science to kids and adults alike.

    My PhD project has me exploring the molecular aetiology of mantle
    cell lymphoma (MCL) using a combination of data types and a variety of bioinformatic
    techniques. My analysis of the mutational landscape of MCL has
    revealed an enrichment of mutations in splicing factors and RNA-binding proteins. Currently,
    I am investigating deregulation of non-coding elements using a large dataset of WGS and RNA-seq MCL tumours.

    I work on implementing and improving pipelines for our Genomic Analysis of Mature B-cell Lymphoma project.
    I’ve taken an interest in incorporating promethION long-read sequencing data into this project to perform various
    analyses exploring copy number variation, simple somatic mutations, and structural variation patterns. PromethION
    sequencing has certain advantages over short read sequencing in that it provides a more comprehensive view on
    structural variant discovery and informs on methylation state. We hope that the addition of promethION data will
    consolidate previous findings, as well as provide further insight to the genomic landscape of this disease.

    I obtained PhD in 2014, following which I received comprehensive training at FDA-NCTR and University of New Mexico.
    During my career, I conducted original research in the area of cancer epigenomics and transcriptomics. While
    performing basic research in cancer biology and epigenetics, I became passionate about scientific discoveries
    in the area of bioinformatics and computational biology. In the Morin lab, I am applying a variety of bioinformatics
    tools to uncover genomic features of Burkitt lymphoma, a form of aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Specifically,
    my research is focused on comparing the genomic and molecular characteristics of adult and pediatric BL, Epstein-Barr
    virus (EBV) positive and negative BL, as well as endemic and sporadic cases, which will allow better diagnosis approaches
    and will ultimately facilitate development of more effective treatment strategies.

    In the Morin lab, I am currently researching circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in various Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma subtypes
    to identify mutation- and progression-based trends. My project aims to infer genome-wide methylation of Burkitt lymphoma (BL)
    and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), as well as explore the benefits and drawbacks of common ctDNA
    quantification strategies for both BL and DLBCL patients across Canada.

    Rare aggressive extra-nodal diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unresponsive to standard treatments
    and has a poor prognosis. My projects aim to genetically characterize these extra-nodal lymphomas to better understand
    potential mechanisms driving their pathologies. One project involves investigating primary extranodal DLBCLs (specifically
    primary DLBCL in the testes and CNS), and understanding biological distinctions that separate these extranodal DLBCLs
    compared to their nodal counterparts, and to examine factors that promote their progression. The other project involves
    examining plasmablastic lymphoma, a disease typically involving immunocompromised individuals. Because of the rarity of this
    disease, very few studies have been able to examine the genomic landscape of this disease in depth. Coming from an epigenetics
    background, I have a particular interest in understanding the dynamics between the genome and epigenome in cancer.

    I perform various computational analyses to assist in the classification of driver genes within Non-Hodgkin’s Lymphoma.
    By using computational methods designed to recognize recurrently mutated elements, it is possible to identify mutational
    hotspots within genes of interest. Hotspots, or genomic regions that contain a higher density of mutations than would be
    expected, can be recognized by analyzing the linear genomic sequence or the 3D structure of the expressed protein.
    3D structure-based methods can supplement driver gene discovery by identifying regions in the tertiary structure that
    may mediate protein function and cell survival. I employ both types of methods for hotspot identification and driver
    gene discovery.

    I completed my B.Tech in Bioengineering from IIT Kanpur, India in 2015. I did my B.Tech project at two different labs.
    First, at Max-Planck Institute, Germany I developed molecular biology techniques to study circular RNA. Second, at IIT Kanpur,
    where I applied computational tools to study olfactory receptor mechanism in Drosophila. I completed my PhD at Simon
    Fraser University in 2021, studying in-depth chemistry and biophysics of nucleic acids, including DNA/RNA
    catalysis and DNA nanotechnology. Towards the end of my PhD, I developed keen interest in applying machine learning models
    to solve biological problems. In the Morin lab, I aim to deploy robust classification and clustering models to enhance the
    current understanding on poorly classified B-cell lymphomas.

    My research project focuses on identifying mutations in patients with relapsed Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma; specifically,
    the analysis of liquid biopsies obtained from these patients. As cells undergo apoptosis, apoptotic bodies containing DNA
    are released into the bloodstream, and this DNA is called cell-free DNA. In patients with cancer, a portion of this
    cell-free DNA originates from malignant cells, termed circulating-tumour DNA. Thus, we can obtain tumour genetic material
    simply by obtaining a blood sample (called a liquid biopsy), which is less invasive and significantly cheaper than traditional
    biopsies. Due to the unique nature of liquid biopsies, I am currently developing several pieces of software for analyzing
    and benchmarking existing mutation-calling tools for use with these types of samples. I am applying these tools to samples
    collected from several clinical trials where liquid biopsies are collected after patients are treated. By comparing the
    mutation landscape of these patients prior to and following treatment, we identify mutations enriched following treatment,
    which may contribute to tumour treatment resistance.

    Recent studies have identified 4 or 5 genetic subgroups in DLBCL, which
    present a novel method of classification for alternative treatment
    strategies.
    My project aims to expand on classifying these subgroups
    in DLBCL using a machine learning approaches utilizing molecular indicators such as mutation status from a set
    of genes and hot spots, copy number status and cell-of-origin.
    I hope to consolidate subtypes from these studies as well as to
    capture novel groups to better describe clinical
    heterogeneity in DLBCL.
