    I am a biochemist and currently a student of the master's degree in biochemistry and bioinformatics at the faculty of biological sciences of the Universidad de Concepción. In my undergraduate studies I was interested in the study of molecular mechanisms related to adaptation in hypersaline desert soils such as the Atacama Desert. Currently I am interested in structural and computational biology, mainly the study of conformational changes in transporters through molecular dynamics simulations.
