    I began my university studies at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Concepción, obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry in 2016. During my studies, I cultivated an interest in physical chemistry and structural biology, which motivated me to enroll in the Master's program in Biochemistry and Bioinformatics at the same university. I completed this program in 2021, summa cum laude. My master's thesis, developed under the guidance of Dr. Alexis Salas, explored the molecular basis of functional selectivity in sugar and polyol transporters. During my years as a student, I also developed an interest in science education, which led me to obtain a teaching degree and a master's in Educational Management and Leadership, as well as a diploma in Higher Education Teaching. Currently, I am actively involved in teaching science across various educational settings and contributing to research at the Nanocell laboratory.

    I'm Melissa, a bioengineering undergraduate student. From the first time I saw a microscope and saw plant cells from an onion at school, I knew that I wanted to work in an area where I could be in a laboratory, so I began to study bioengineering where I learned about cell and molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. At present, I am engaged in conducting research for my undergraduate thesis. The focus of my study involves mapping tyrosine kinase proteins within tumor cell lines, with the ultimate goal of expediting the advancement of novel cancer treatments. As part of my thesis work, I am actively involved in conducting cell cultures and laboratory experiments. Additionally, I have recently been acquiring knowledge in data analysis techniques through my involvement with the Laboratory of Molecular Dynamics of Cancer.

    I am Juan Carlos, a fifth year biochemistry student. From a very young age I was curious about the world around me, always trying to understand the reason for what caught my attention, a curiosity that only grew with the passage of time. The moment I discovered my current career I knew it was the place where that childhood feeling could flourish, and when I entered the world of research laboratories I strengthened that idea even more. I am currently doing my research unit for a future thesis, with the aim of this I have been learning about data analysis, molecular dynamics, in order to perform drug design oriented to new therapies against cancer.

    I am a bioengineer with a master's degree in biochemistry and bioinformatics from the University of Concepción. I conducted both my undergraduate and master's theses under the guidance of Dr. Alexis Salas Burgos, where I worked on the development of machine learning-based methods for therapeutic antibody design. During my academic tenure in the Nanocell laboratory, I also collaborated on projects related to the analysis of massive sequencing data, specifically WES and RNAseq analyses. In the educational realm, I also participated in programming workshops for elementary school children. I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Computational Biology program (from 2022 to present) at the San Sebastián University, researching the application of language models in the computational design of peptidic vaccines.

    I did my undergraduate at University of Concepción in Plant Biotechnology (2010-2015, cum laude). My thesis was on fungicide resistance of Botrytis cinerea in Eucalyptus nurseries and its relation with the pathogen aggressiveness and genetic diversity based on the presence of transponsons. Later, on 2017 I enjoyed the nanocell lab doing my MSc in biochemistry and bioinformatics at University of Concepción, the project was about strategies of transcriptome assembly of Eucalyptus spp. under cold stress and transcription factors involved in the process. I learned programing languages such as; R and Python, and the most special part was to participate in a social program that taught coding in chilean public schools under the project 1024 programadores, leader by Alexis Salas. I'm currently in FABI, University of Pretoria, South Africa where im studying plant pathology, mainly resistance against diseases at molecular, biochemical and anatomical level. Personally, I really like getting to know places and cultures (languages, arts and music).
