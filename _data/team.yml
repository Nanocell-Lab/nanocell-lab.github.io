    I began my university studies at the School of Pharmacy of the University of Concepción, obtaining my Bachelor's degree in Biochemistry in 2016. During my studies, I cultivated an interest in physical chemistry and structural biology, which motivated me to enroll in the Master's program in Biochemistry and Bioinformatics at the same university. I completed this program in 2021, summa cum laude. My master's thesis, developed under the guidance of Dr. Alexis Salas, explored the molecular basis of functional selectivity in sugar and polyol transporters. During my years as a student, I also developed an interest in science education, which led me to obtain a teaching degree and a master's in Educational Management and Leadership, as well as a diploma in Higher Education Teaching. Currently, I am actively involved in teaching science across various educational settings and contributing to research at the Nanocell laboratory.

    I'm a bioengineer, currently studying in the master's program of biochemistry and bioinformatics at Universidad de Concepcion <a href="http://www.udec.cl">Universidad de Concepción</a>. In my undergraduate studies, I was interested in the studies of ion channels and their contributions to the mechanism of pain. Currently, I'm working on the studies of enzymes highly used on cancer therapies, such as asparaginases, using molecular dynamics and QM/MM hybrid methods.

    I am a biochemist and currently a student of the master's degree in biochemistry and bioinformatics at the faculty of biological sciences of the Universidad de Concepción. In my undergraduate studies I was interested in the study of molecular mechanisms related to adaptation in hypersaline desert soils such as the Atacama Desert. Currently I am interested in structural and computational biology, mainly the study of conformational changes in transporters through molecular dynamics simulations.

    I'm Melissa, a bioengineering undergraduate student. From the first time I saw a microscope and saw plant cells from an onion at school, I knew that I wanted to work in an area where I could be in a laboratory, so I began to study bioengineering where I learned about cell and molecular biology, biochemistry and microbiology. At present, I am engaged in conducting research for my undergraduate thesis. The focus of my study involves mapping tyrosine kinase proteins within tumor cell lines, with the ultimate goal of expediting the advancement of novel cancer treatments. As part of my thesis work, I am actively involved in conducting cell cultures and laboratory experiments. Additionally, I have recently been acquiring knowledge in data analysis techniques through my involvement with the Laboratory of Molecular Dynamics of Cancer.

    I am Juan Carlos, a fifth year biochemistry student. From a very young age I was curious about the world around me, always trying to understand the reason for what caught my attention, a curiosity that only grew with the passage of time. The moment I discovered my current career I knew it was the place where that childhood feeling could flourish, and when I entered the world of research laboratories I strengthened that idea even more. I am currently doing my research unit for a future thesis, with the aim of this I have been learning about data analysis, molecular dynamics, in order to perform drug design oriented to new therapies against cancer.
