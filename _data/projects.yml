- name: Elucidating the role of membrane transporters in cellular adaptation to the tumor microenvironment from gastric cancer
  description: >
    Gastric cancer is one of the deadliest cancers in the world and requires your attention due to the absence of early biomarkers and the difficulty of predicting its tumor progression. The complexity of the SN is related to the high intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) at the regional or spatial level, represented by the genotypic diversity of the gastric cancer cell (GCC) at the inter- and intratumoral level, manifesting differential adaptation capacities against the tumor microenvironment (TEM). The GCCs could alter the nutritional conditions of their environment by reprogramming the metabolism of carbohydrates, lipids, and amino acids, generating resource deprivation for the non-cancerous cells of their TEM. The transporter proteins are a metabolic pivot, directly defining the concentrations of metabolites in the TEM and in the subcellular distribution. The role of transporters in these adaptive processes is beginning to be revisited, where hexose transporters, such as glucose facilitative transporter 1 (GLUT1), are associated with diagnostic strategies and are a classic marker of cancer progression. However, the role of other hexose transporters, their expression levels, mutational profiles, and the possibility of identifying new adaptation mechanisms to TEM restrictions. Finally, investigating these processes allows us to project ourselves towards the translation of this information in the development of new immunological therapies directed with neo-antigens from transporters, the design of therapies that directly affect the transporters, the development of subcellular therapies and the exploration of the development of an index of GC tumor progression based on multi-omics profiles associated with hexose metabolism.

- name: The role of the Fc Gamma receptor locus in resistance to R-CHOP
  description: >
    Through genomic characterization of DLBCL we identified somatic amplification
    of the Fc gamma receptor 2B gene (FCGR2B) as a feature in ~5% of cases. We also 
    found the expression of FCGR2B (by RNA-seq) was prognostic in multiple DLBCL cohorts. 
    FCGR2B contributes to treatment resistance by promoting the internalization of the 
    rituximab antibody by malignant cells, allowing them to evade immune detection. 
    It may therefore serve as an important biomarker to identify high-risk patients and 
    stratify them to recieve newer immunotherapies that can mitigate the effects of high 
    FCGR2B expression. Understanding the genetic mechanisms that drive FCGR2B amplification 
    and overexpression has been complicated by the segmental duplication that affects 
    the FCGR locus, which makes it difficult to accurately align short reads to FCGR2B 
    or its closely-related paralog FCGR2C. We have been employing long-read Oxford 
    Nanopore sequencing and Bionano optical mapping to accurately characterize the 
    structural and single nucleotide variation within the locus.

- name: Resolving clonal structure and evolution patterns in DLBCL
  description: >
    Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma is a genetically heterogeneous form of cancer, 
    with different cells in the tumour acquiring different mutations. This 
    intra-tumour heterogeneity can have profound effects on treatment; if a clonal 
    subpopulations is resistant to treatment, it will reform the tumour following 
    treatment, causing the patient to relapse. We are recieving samples from several
    clinical trials exploring different salvage therapies for patients with relapsed
    DLBCL. Tumour biopsies and liquid biopsies are being collected from patients 
    both before and after they are treated. Using these temporal sources of tumour DNA,
    we can identify clonal subpopulations in the tumour, 
    and further explore how the tumour evolves and adapts in the face of a strong 
    selective pressure such as treatment. The mutations unique to these resistant 
    clonal subpopulations can be explored to determine which mutation(s) result 
    in treatment resistance. We can further determine if these mutations are 
    detectable prior to treatment, which may allow patient to be screened for resistance 
    mutations before they are treated.
