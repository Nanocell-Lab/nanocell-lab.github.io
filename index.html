    <h2>Cancer's Molecular Dynamics Laboratory (CMDL)</h2>

    <p>The laboratory combines molecular biology, analysis of molecular dynamics, and bioinformatics methodologies for the design, analysis, and techniques for the validation of the biological hypotheses.</p>

    <h3>About the Laboratory</h3>

    <p>With an interdisciplinary approach, our team has developed research on the molecular dynamics processes connected to cancer. This work includes data analysis using sophisticated multi-omics characteristic classification methods, software development for molecular design applications, molecular characterization in biomarker cell lines, and the proliferation of tumor cells in relation to their microenvironment. The Laboratory of Molecular Dynamics in Cancer is a group with more than ten years of combined experience, technical staff, twelve postgraduate theses, and numerous national and international collaborations.</p>

    <p>Located in Edificio del Arco second floor of the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Concepci√≥n, Chile.</p>

    <p>The following research areas are being investigated in the lab at the moment:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Hereditary cancer profiles and their effects on breast, ovarian, gastric, and colon cancer.</li>
        <li>Regional and evolutionary analysis of the development of cancer along with an assessment of the tumour microenvironment.</li>
        <li>Perform the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting neoplastic cells linked to serine/threonine kinase receptors are modelled in vitro.</li>
        <li>The creation of nanomedicines that precisely identify therapeutic targets and activate them at the subcellular level for efficient diagnosis and treatment.</li>
    </ol>


    <h3>Postgraduate Thesis</h3>

    <p> Postgraduate Thesis developed in the laboratory: <a href="https://postgrado.udec.cl/programas/detalle/tesis/200600033363">Nanocell Thesis at UdeC</a></p>

    <h3>Why the name Nanocell?</h3>

    <p>The first project awarded by Dr. Alexis Salas in 2009 was an explora - outresearch - called: "Nanocell: A trip inside the cell in 80ms", this project consisted of teaching the molecular biology involved in high-risk diseases prevalence in Chile.</p>
