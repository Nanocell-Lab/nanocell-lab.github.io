## Molecular Dynamics in Cancer Disease Laboratory (MDCDL)

The laboratory combines molecular biology, analysis of molecular dynamics, and bioinformatics methodologies for the design, analysis, and techniques for the validation of the biological hypotheses.

### About the Laboratory

With an interdisciplinary approach, our team has developed research on the molecular dynamics processes connected to cancer. This work includes data analysis using sophisticated multi-omics characteristic classification methods, software development for molecular design applications, molecular characterization in biomarker cell lines, and the proliferation of tumor cells in relation to their microenvironment. The Laboratory of Molecular Dynamics in Cancer is a group with more than ten years of combined experience, technical staff, twelve postgraduate theses, and numerous national and international collaborations.  

Located in Edificio del Arco second floor of the Department of Pharmacology of the University of Concepción, Chile. 

The following research areas are being investigated in the lab at the moment: 

1) Hereditary cancer profiles and their effects on breast, ovarian, gastric, and colon cancer. 
2) Regional and evolutionary analysis of the development of cancer along with an assessment of the tumour microenvironment.
3) Perform the development of allosteric inhibitors targeting neoplastic cells linked to serine/threonine kinase receptors are modelled in vitro. 
4) The creation of nanomedicines that precisely identify therapeutic targets and activate them at the subcellular level for efficient diagnosis and treatment.  

### Main Molecular and Computational Techniques 

**Computational Biology**. All the members of the laboratory are trained in computer programming skills, the preferred language of the laboratory is python, and code maintenance is done with github. For the development of data analysis protocols, we use Jupyter Lab, for writing documents or presentations Google docs and Google slides, and Zotero for reference management.

**Molecular Biology**. The laboratory has skills in protein structure design and drug design, for which bacterial and cell culture, primer and plasmid design, modification by site-directed mutations, expression quantification by RT-PCR, quantification of protein analysis by Western Blot, analysis of interactions by ITC, dichroism and massive analysis with RNA/DNA sequencing, sequencing of proteins and metabolites.

### Infrastructure

**Computational biology laboratory.** It has a 40m2 surface area, air conditioning, chairs, cabinets, and a programmers' desk. It includes eight MacPro computers with two CPUs, 20GB of RAM, and a 1TB hard drive, as well as a High-Performance Cluster (HPC) with 192 cores. a Cisco server of 1GB. Dell laptop with two CPUs (eight cores) and a 4 TB hard drive. two desks each with an iMac 27. The installed software includes Modeler, DOCK6, VINA, NAMD, CHARMM, and GROMACS for structural biology. ii) For the Chemometrics, Obabel, SDL, ChemineR, Gaussian, Newchem, and ORCAS programs. The R, Python, and C programming languages are used to create the scripts and software that our team creates. The databases are created using the ZINC, MongoDB, and MySQL programming languages. There are machine learning libraries from Scikit-learn as well as deep learning implementations like Pytorch and Tensorflow (both GPU-accelerated). Everyone who works in the lab has received Python programming training. These computational biology resources are available for the development of aims 1 and 3.

**Molecular biology laboratory.** All the tools required to handle DNA, RNA, sample preparation and quantification, reverse transcription, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) are present in this roughly 90m2 space. The lab is equipped with the automated nucleotide extraction system (Zybio EXM6000), tissue homogenizer (precellys), centrifuges and ultracentrifuges, shaker incubators for culturing microorganisms, autoclave system, 4°C, -20°C, and -85°C refrigerators, as well as laminar flow chambers for manipulating nucleotides and DNA and protein electrophoresis chambers. The University of Concepción, on the other hand, has a central system (MATPEL) for the storage, collection, and removal of all waste material that will be produced in this project. The creation of objective 2 will require the use of these available resources. These tools are added to the requested resources to pay for the DNA and RNA extraction and purification kit. and to cover the cost of NGS sequencing services.
